- make dataiterator only return the last occurance of a key

- implement package priority (for things like Debian's pin feature)

- merge SUSETAGS_FILE_* and  REPOSITORY_REPOMD_* keys into REPOSITORY_RESOURCE

- re-order key ids

- deal with DIRSTR entries having dirid 0 (for source rpms)

- drop patchcheck

- rename repo2solv.sh to repo2solv (maybe rewrite in C?)

- obey -A option in repo2solv

- make FAVOR handling deal with versions

- write more manpages

- bindings: selection.flags() should be a attribute and not a method

- rename repodata_lookup_id_uninternalized to repodata_lookup_id_voidid_uninternalized
  and add a notfound argument
